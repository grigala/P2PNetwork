Notes for the code:

- For adding and removing nodes, enter the key into the textfield next to the button and then press add/remove
- when removing the node from the network, the gui doesn't fully update,
    which is why there still are green lines and old entries in the dropdown list
- stabilize gets called periodically via the fixfingers function
--> needs to be run a while until the finger tables are correct
